# Choochoobot

These scripts power the Twitter account [@choochoobot](https://twitter.com/choochoobot), the trains-botting friend we all know and love. Generating trains requires only Python 3, and tweeting them requires Twython and a set of Twitter credentials (not provided).

This code is released under a free software license and you are welcome to fork it and generate trains to your heart's content. I'm well aware that it's a goofy little thing, but because this is a personal creative project I will probabl not accept pull requests or issues about anything other than its technical operation.
